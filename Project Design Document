- Colour:
The colour light green is soothing and calming, in addition it evokes a feeling of
being in harmony with nature. We think this choice of colour will make our target
group more at ease while using our application, possibly increasing their tolerance
for small irritations and frustrations. We also find that this particular shade of
green is easy on the eyes, which may otherwise serve as hindrance.

We have matched this colour with varying shades of light grey, which is mainly used
to attract attention and offer contrast between the multiple parts which makes up a
view. In general, we use lighter colours to draw attention and darker colours to blend
into the background. In addition to this, we use contrasts of different hues of grey
to clearly demarcate different components within the same view.

We are aware that the colour green can be considered as a cold colour, however due to
its muted nature and the shade we have picked, we found this to be less relevant than
it otherwise would have been for other hues. In other words, the colour picked strikes
a rather good balance between respect and homeliness.

In order to introduce a simple and clear way for the user to understand the flow of the
application a new colour was introduced to indicate moving forward. The colour chosen for
this was yellow, since it offers the impression of curiosity and positivity. It was then
applied to a select few buttons throughout the many views of the program, all of which
serve to change and advance the website's flow.
